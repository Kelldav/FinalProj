 Final Project For Interactive Media Made By Brandon Angod

The game is a fighting game featuring one character Kachu. Kachu must defeat "Brute" by depleating his health bar to 0. Controls are written in the menu. 
 
Later stuff to add:
 More Characters.
 More Stages.
 Possibly figure out a better way to do command inputs i.e. Quarter circle motions.
 Throw in some projectile attacks to be created from the players body and delete when the collider hits with particle effects.
